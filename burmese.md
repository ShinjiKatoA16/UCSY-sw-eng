As for encoding issue, following Web site describes well. <http://www.unicode.org/faq/myanmar.html> .
Using Zawgy IME and font with encoding of Unicode is not problem, if there is a proper tools. But using Zawgy encoding will bring problems.  
In case of Japan, there were several encoding for Japanese characters such as Shift-JIS or EUC, most web browser automatically detected encoding and displayed properly.
