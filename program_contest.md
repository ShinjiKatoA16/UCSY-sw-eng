# Programming Contest

## ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)

ICPC is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. The contest is sponsored by IBM.
In 2015, 40,266 students from 2,736 universities in 102 countries participated.

As for programming languages, [rule of the ICPC 2017](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules) states that C/C++ and Java is to be used except World Finals.

Some important rules from 2016 ICPC at UCSY as follows.

- Each problem must be solved within 30 seconds (?)
- Team must send a source code to Judge, and test will be executed on Judge's machine. (as for C/C++, 32bit compiler is used ?)
- **All solutions must read from standard input and write to standard output.** ```program <file.in >file.out```
- stderr is ignored by Judge, it can be used as a debug output
- All lines of output must be left justified
- All lines of output must end with ```\n```
- **All lines of output must not contain any blank characters at the end of the line.**

## Code Jam

Sponsored by Google, Code Jam is one of the biggest programming contest. Qualification round was held from 7th Apr to 9th Apr (27 hours) this year (2017). In order to go to Round-1, need to solve at least 2 problems from 4.

[Problem of Qualification round 2017](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard)

Probelm A and B are relatively easy. C is not so difficult if data size is not so big, there are 3 data sets of Problem-C based on data size.
Large data handling is one of the characteristics of Code Jam.

Google has programming contest page for students <https://code.google.com/codejam/kickstart/>


## Facebook Hacker Cup

Facebook sponsors programming competition as well. [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/round/1760504744276109/)


## Other sites

There are many progamming competition sites. Some of them are

- [Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/)  famous
- [Code chef](https://www.codechef.com/)  contains many problems
- [Code forces](http://codeforces.com/)  good for beginner ?
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)  contains good problems to brush up mathmatical sense. Archives section contains easier problems.


## Where to start ?

Easier 2-3 problems of qualification round of Code Jam seems to be a good choice. 
Problem statement of Project Eular is short, and contains good problems.
