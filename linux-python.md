# Installing Python
Python2 and Python3 are included in Ubuntu desktop.

# Installing Python package
Python packages such as numpy can be installed using PIP. It is installed in
each user's environment, so sudo is not necessary.

````
   $ python3 -m pip install numpy matplotlib 
````

# Installing development envrironment for Python
* IDLE (IDLE3): light weight IDE (Integrated develoment environment), recommended for beginners.
* Pycharm, Eclipse: heavy and feature rich IDE, may be JAVA programmers like these
* vim or emacs: Many professional programmers prefer either of these editors. Atom is becoming popular these days.

I would like to recommend IDLE to beginners and VIM to advanced level. VIM or
emacs is almost mandatory when reading Linux kernel source code.

## Python setup for VIM
* Create (or update) ~/.vimrc to include following lines.  
````
    autocmd FileType python setl autoindent
    autocmd FileType python setl smartindent cinwords=if,elif,else,for,while,try,except,finally,def,class
    autocmd FileType python setl tabstop=8 expandtab shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4
    au BufNewFile *.py 0r ~/.pyheader
````

* Create ~/.pyheader which contains default header
````
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    #-*- coding: utf-8 -*-
````
